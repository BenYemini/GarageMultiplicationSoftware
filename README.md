# Garage Multiplication SoftwareðŸš—ðŸ’»

Welcome to the Garage Multiplication Software project! This project was developed as part of an intensive course on "Object-oriented programming in the .NET environment & the C# language". It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing garage operations efficiently.

## Overview

The project is structured around several key components, each fulfilling a specific role in the software's architecture. Here's a brief overview of the main components:

- **SessionExecutor**: A public class serving as a client session shell, orchestrating all user interactions and executing various functions provided during the session.

- **Garage**: A public class encapsulating the garage object and providing a rich API for performing garage operations through session execution.

- **UserInterface**: A public class offering APIs for presenting content to the user within the SessionExecutor and handling user inputs via HandleIO.

- **HandleIO**: A public class responsible for validating and handling user inputs, ensuring data integrity throughout session execution.

- **InputValidityChecks**: A public class housing input validity checks, ensuring that user inputs meet specified criteria.

- **ValueOutOfRangeException**: A custom exception class constructed and thrown during input validation checks when values fall outside acceptable ranges.

- **GarageCarCard**: A class holding car card objects within the garage, featuring relevant fields for efficient management.

- **Wheel**: A class containing objects representing vehicle wheels, providing specific actions for wheel management.

- **Engine**: A class serving as a parent class for electric and fuel engines, encapsulating common functionality and behaviors.

- **ElectricEngine & FuelEngine**: Subclasses of Engine, each representing specific engine types and providing operations tailored to their respective functionalities.

- **VehiclesObjectCreation**: A class responsible for building vehicle objects, offering an API to facilitate session execution.

- **GarageDictionaries & eNumsForGarage**: Helper classes providing APIs for configuring various objects and enums used across the project.

- **Car, Motorcycle, Truck**: Classes representing different vehicle types, each containing relevant fields and functionalities specific to their type.

- **Program**: A class containing the main function responsible for initiating the client session using SessionExecutor.

## Project ContextðŸŒŸ

This project is a testament to the principles of object-oriented programming, emphasizing concepts such as readability, scalability, and maintainable code. Throughout the development process, I strived to adhere to these principles, ensuring that the software's architecture promotes modularity, encapsulation, and code reuse.

By leveraging the power of object-oriented design, this project demonstrates the ability to model real-world entities effectively, manage complex interactions between components, and provide a flexible and extensible solution for garage management.

## ConclusionðŸŽ‰

The Garage Multiplication Software project represents a culmination of knowledge and skills acquired during the course, showcasing proficiency in object-oriented programming paradigms and best practices.
